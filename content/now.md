# Right now I am...

I'm trying to succeed with one crypto project. It's not that interesting internally ~~it is~~ but I can't really tell anything about it. *How many times I told people about our projects?..*

Looking for a place outside of Motherland. Basically because I don't really feel safe inside Russia. I don't really see any immediate ways to achieve stability and confidence in the future that is required to do some of projects I want to build.

Regarding projects I'm wrapping my head around. Right now I have two ideas:
- **Podcast SponsorBlock** is more of an ecosystem of plugins then a single thing. At the moment I'm thinking of podcast episodes id generation and working on a web interface similar to original SponsorBlock but for audio only.
- **Archivator** --- a complex solution crawling walled gardens for your data and saving it for your future usage. Just because Facebook and Google can't compete with your life expectancy ðŸ˜†

I also try to help with developing [Reatom](https://reatom.dev) but not so many contributions. The project is my passion for several months now and I really want to give back joy of communication and help I had there.

And the last but not least I'm going to fill this site with some content.
