# Things I use

## Operation system 
- Fedora 39
  - Theme: Flat-Remix-GTK-Blue-Dark
  <!-- - Icons: Paper -->
  - Gnome extensions:
    - [Blur my Shell](https://github.com/aunetx/blur-my-shell)
    - [Dash to Dock](https://micheleg.github.io/dash-to-dock/) because ubuntu broke default one
    <!-- - [Draw On Your Screen 2](https://github.com/zhrexl/DrawOnYourScreen2). I don't know what happened to the first version, honestly. -->
- Windows 11 just to play games from time to time.

## Programs
I'm a Web developer first of all, so here are programs that I use daily for work:

### Editors üìù

- **WebStorm** -- that's the core of my workflows and I spend like 70% of time in it. No fancy plugins other then several language syntaxes as it's batteries included.
- **VisualStudio Code** -- I use it for things other then Web development. Like Ansible roles, YAML files and .env files
  <!-- - Extensions: -->
  - [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) that allows me execute .http files
  - [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) because default integration sucks
  - ... and many language specific things
  <!-- - Theme: [Ayu Mirage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teabyii.ayu) -->
- **Vim** -- is used if I don't really want to leave my terminal
  - .vimrc you can [find here](https://github.com/BANOnotIT/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc)

### Graphical ones üñåÔ∏è
- **Firefox** because it does what I want it to do
  - Theme: Dark one
  - Extensions:
    - [Simple Tab Groups](https://github.com/drive4ik/simple-tab-groups) is used to implement "contexts" in browsers
    - [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/) was primary thing but nowadays many sites implement `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` and it's maintainer doesn't think it's good.
    - [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/) to block ads. I did no research on alternatives. This one just works
    - [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/) skips sponsored segments in YouTube videos
    - [Multi-Account Containers](https://github.com/mozilla/multi-account-containers) is just a thing that tries to give different cookies in different tabs. Less useful then chrome's accounts though
    - [Tabliss](https://tabliss.io/) does pretty home page üíÖ
- [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) holds all my passwords.
- **Inkscape** to do vector graphics
- **qBitTorrent** to download ~~films~~ manuals and Ubuntu ISOs

### Console üòé

- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) is a great terminal
- **zsh** is a great shell containing all features I may think of because no fish needed! I cook it lazily with oh-my-zsh:
  - [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) to show a command I might want to enter just by first several words. Just like in fish.
  - [zsh-history-substring-search](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search) gives ability to add variants from history using simple <kbd>‚Üë / ‚Üì</kbd>. Just like in fish.
  - [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) to highlight things. Just like in fish.
- [starship](https://starship.rs/) to show prompt. Much faster then zsh themes. My config you can [find here](https://github.com/BANOnotIT/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/starship.toml).

### Utils üß∞

- [Volta](https://volta.sh/) to manage Node.js versions
- **NPM** for package management
- **Yarn** for scripts running. Yeah, just an alias to do `y dev` instead of `npm run dev`
- [lnav](https://lnav.org/) helps me wade through logs with ease.
- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) is a `cd` command but with fuzzy search so that I can just do `z e p f` which will cd to `~/Projects/Example/packages/frontend`. A great tool that works best with autosuggestions.
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) rips original `grep` in pieces.
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) finds files fast. Faster then you might think of finding it.
